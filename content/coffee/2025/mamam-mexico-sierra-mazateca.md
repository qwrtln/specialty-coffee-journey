The bag design itself deserves some attention.
Instead of a sticker or print, there is a designer label similar to the one found on clothes.
A very creative and unconventional approach.

Taste-wise the coffee also delivers on all fronts.
I can't say I felt mulberry (never tried a fresh one, though), but grapefruit and mirabelle plum notes were noticeable.

Mexican coffee is also not easy to come by where I live.
