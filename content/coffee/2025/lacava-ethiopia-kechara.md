While not remarkable, this coffee offers a unique experience that deserves to be drunk as a ritual.
One of the unique characteristics of Lacava is that the pictures on the bag perfectly encapsulate the taste.
While tasting two or three of their coffees side-by-side, you could tell which coffee is which by looking only at the picture.
My only regret is that it's 200g instead of the standard 250g.
