A gift from abroad.
While it doesn't match the quality of the rest of the lineup here, it served as a great drink for multitasking.
For instance, while working or attending online business calls.

P.S. I rarely get a chance to try their coffee, but they seem to change the design of [their bags](/tags/kitchen-coffee-roasters/) every time.
Interestingly, judging by the sticker on the bottom of the bag, Belarus levies excise tax on specialty coffee.
