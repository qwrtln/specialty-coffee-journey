Hardly ever does a cup in a café dazzle you on the first sip.
That was the case with White Lotus.
The rich floral taste was so impeccable, it stopped me mid-thought and made me savor it for a while.
I decided to order a bag before I even finished my cup.

Sadly, I wasn't able to replicate that taste at home.
The key learning is that it's not only the grind and brewing method that count.
Serious specialty cafés also invest in equipment that ensures their water has the right mineral content.

The objectively inferior (but still very high-quality) [Ice Tease](/coffee/2025/dak-ethiopia-danche/) occasionally tasted better at home.
