Coffee brought back from a short trip.
Even though you can sense distinct gesha flavor, I wouldn't call the quality exceptional, as the packaging claims.
Pleasant notes were always accompanied by undesirable woody or smoky ones, despite my efforts to adjust the brewing method.
It was best enjoyed while focusing on something else, not when pondering the coffee itself.
