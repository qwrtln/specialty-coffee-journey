After a [recent](/coffee/2025/kitchen-coffee-roasters-kenya-kirinyaga) rather disappointing experience with coffee from Belarus, I kept my expectations low.
This one, however, turned out to be surprisingly pleasant.
I rarely can taste all of the notes the roaster lists on the packaging.
This time I could distinctly taste all four: orange, caramel, chocolate, and blueberry.

Peruvian coffees definitely deserve more attention.
