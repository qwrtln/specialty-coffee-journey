Although not as flavor-rich as its [predecessor](/coffee/2025/mamam-mexico-sierra-mazateca), this coffee still ranks exceptionally high in overall taste quality.
The flavor is exactly what you might expect from Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee - very fruity and sweet.
As a whole, this coffee is a joy every step of the way.
From the packaging to the unground beans, the aroma during grinding to the final brew - it's a top-tier experience.
