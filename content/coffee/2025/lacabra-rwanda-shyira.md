La Cabra is Spanish for "goat", a rather peculiar name for a Danish roaster.
It might be a reference to the coffee origin story from Ethiopian folklore.
My first encounter with them was during a short trip, when I walked into a promising-looking coffee shop and was served an incredibly clean cup brewed with a Delter Press.

A coffee shop serving brews from Delter is such a rare occurrence, and having it taste so incredibly clean naturally led me to order a bag.
Their prices are on the higher end, but the quality is impeccable.
They promise a lot and actually deliver.
This one worked well in both the AeroPress and Delter as a daily brew.

P.S. Roasters positioning themselves as premium tend to put their bags in well-designed boxes (also see [Mazelab](/tags/mazelab) and [Drop Coffee](/tags/drop-coffee)).
La Cabra goes the extra mile even with the bag itself, which has a very pleasant tactile feel.
