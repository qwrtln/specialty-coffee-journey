The roaster used to run [the most orthodox café](/cafes/crooked-nose-vilnius-lithuania/) I've ever been to.
Even though it's no longer in operation, their passion and absolute dedication to quality shine through in the beans they roast.

Yemeni coffee is hard to come by.
This one offered a very distinct flavor of rubus blackberries, which is a very rare occurrence.
In addition, the coffee is packed in a playfully designed box that's a pure joy to interact with.

This coffee absolutely delighted everyone I served it to.
One of my friends even asked which coffee from his favorite roaster would come closest to this one, to which I sadly responded: "None."

Scans alone won't do the box justice.
Here's a photo of the actual packaging:

It's even fun just to rotate, isn't it?
