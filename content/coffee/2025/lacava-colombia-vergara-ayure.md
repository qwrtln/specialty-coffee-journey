The first coffee with thermal shock processing I've tried.
The fruity flavor was so incredible it's hard to believe it wasn't infused with actual fruits.
I've had the opportunity to try other thermal shock processed coffees since then, and must say that the fruity bomb taste is quite distinct and hard to confuse with anything else.
A smaller 200g bag instead of the standard 250g seems to be the trademark of Lacava's premium offerings.
