The Swiss Water decaffeination method promises a lot in terms of maintaining the original taste of the coffee.
I couldn't tell if the coffee itself was low quality (succinct info on the bag would suggest so), or if the process actually took its toll.
Anyway, my usual AeroPress and pour-over recipes yielded poor results.
I had to drink it with a splash of milk.
A reasonable choice if you suddenly find yourself in need of an evening cappuccino.
