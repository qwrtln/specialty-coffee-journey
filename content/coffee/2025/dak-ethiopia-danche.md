I have yet to dislike a coffee that came in a stylish box.
I wish more roasters invested in the experience like that.

DAK managed to produce a roast and name it in a way that perfectly encompasses the taste.
"Ice Tease" tasted exactly like it sounds — like a cup of black iced tea with lemon.
During a traditional blind cupping with friends, this one was identified immediately after the first slurp.

Moreover, not only did it taste great and come in stylish packaging, but the materials themselves, both plastic and paper, have a pleasant texture, making it a joy to take off the shelf.
