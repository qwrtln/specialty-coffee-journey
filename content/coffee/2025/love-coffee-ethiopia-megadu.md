Sometimes serendipitous events make you question your life choices.
I picked up this bag from a coffee shop I wandered into during a trip abroad, which happened to be hosting a cupping event.
Following the roaster's recommendation (who was leading the event), I decided to reduce my brewing temperature for all coffees from 96°C to 95°C.
Additionally, when brewing a single cup with an AeroPress, I now add about 10% more water to the final cup.
This gives me one or two extra sips, while consistently improving the cup quality.
