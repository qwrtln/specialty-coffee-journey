### Note:
1. These ratings are based on cup quality and reflect my personal opinion as a coffee enthusiast, not a professional assessment.
2. Tier placement is not a definitive measure of a roaster's overall quality.
   Different roasters may prioritize various business aspects, such as serving different market segments or balancing between product development and marketing investments.
1. Rankings within the same tier have no particular order.
