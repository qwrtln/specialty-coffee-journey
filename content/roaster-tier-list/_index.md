### Remember that:
1. I'm judging by the quality of the cup. I'm not a coffee professional, this is just my personal opinion.
1. Lower tier doesn't necessarily mean worse roaster.
It could mean different business strategy, like less affluent target group or more money on marketing rather than roasting.
1. Ordering within the same tier doesn't matter.
