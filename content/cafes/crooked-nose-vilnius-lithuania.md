This is not your typical café - it's a departure from conventional expectations.
Stepping inside feels like entering a meditative sanctuary.
Here, black filter coffee is elevated to a ceremonial art form.

|*An exercise in pure minimalism.*|

The menu's dedication to simplicity is absolute.
No food, no milk options, not even espresso.
In their pursuit of purity, the owners opt for cloth filters over paper ones.
