Update: this café closed shortly after our visit.
The owners wanted to focus their efforts on coffee roasting.
The rest of the text remains for historical reasons.

This is not your typical café - it's a departure from conventional expectations.
Stepping inside feels like entering a meditative sanctuary.
Here, black filter coffee is elevated to a ceremonial art form.

|*An exercise in pure minimalism.*|

The menu's dedication to simplicity is absolute.
No food, no milk options, not even espresso.
In their pursuit of purity, the owners opt for cloth filters over paper ones.

|*A space designed for coffee contemplation.*|

The experience is incomparably intense and singular.
Watch as baristas execute their meticulously refined brewing methods.
Then surrender to the profound depths of flavor in your cup.
