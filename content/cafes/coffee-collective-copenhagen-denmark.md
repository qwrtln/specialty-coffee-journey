Just outside the city center, this café occupies what feels like a spacious apartment in an old building of a peaceful neighborhood.

Even on weekdays, finding a seat is a challenge.
Rather than a typical café, the atmosphere mirrors a house party where mingling with other guests is part of the experience.
In fact, securing a spot requires social interaction - we found ourselves asking a couple at a four-seat table if we could join them, which they warmly welcomed.

The party-like ambiance intensifies as you navigate through multiple rooms and doorways while searching for the restroom.
We decided to match this unique atmosphere by selecting one of their premium coffee offerings.
The quality impressed us so much that we [took a bag home](/coffee/2023/coffee-collective-bolivia-takesi).

Visit for exceptional coffee served in a genuinely homey atmosphere.
