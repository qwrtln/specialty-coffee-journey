I was promised to be led to the best coffee spot in the city, so my expectations were high.
Why Knot delivered.
The coffee selection was clearly displayed on the wall menu.
This was a rather peculiar choice, as normally you have to ask the barista about their current stock.
This place stands in stark contrast to others, where milk-based drinks are the most common offerings.

The experience is enhanced by an interesting design choice of two colors: white interior with light brown wooden furnishings.
Many elements, like tables and shelves on the walls, are angular (hexagonal or octagonal), instead of the typical rectangular or round shapes.
