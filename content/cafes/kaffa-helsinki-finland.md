The café's unconventional entrance feels almost hidden from view.
Descending the stairs gives the impression of entering an underground library.
Yet once inside, you're greeted by a surprisingly bright and spacious interior.

The venue regularly hosts training sessions and workshops for coffee enthusiasts.
Unfortunately, none were scheduled during our visit.

What truly distinguishes this place is their exceptional hand-brewed coffee offered at remarkably reasonable prices.
The taste was so impressive that we decided to [buy a bag](/coffee/2024/kaffa-colombia-el-refugio) after the first sip.

Their dedication to coffee extends beyond the beverages - even the wall artwork is created using coffee as a medium.
These simple sketches provide the perfect backdrop for a relaxing coffee experience.
