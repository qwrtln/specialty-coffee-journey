You might expect that visiting a tourist destination like Rhodes would mean compromising on specialty coffee.
Fortunately, local favorite Monk proves otherwise.
While such a café might blend into the landscape of a metropolitan area, it stands out as a rare find in this historic town.

The café quickly became our daily breakfast destination throughout our stay.
Though the menu is concise, each item is executed with precision and care.
Starting each morning with our hand-brewed coffee became a cherished ritual of our visit.

The Greeks are doing something I've never seen anywhere else - they deliver freshly brewed coffee right to your door.
Every so often a phone rings, baristas prepare coffee to go, and then one of them hops on a scooter to deliver it.
