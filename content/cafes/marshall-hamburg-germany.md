This is the first coffee shop I've encountered that operates strictly by reservation only.
True to German precision and order, bookings must be made at least a day in advance.
Each seating is precisely scheduled for 90 minutes.
Despite the café being relatively empty during our visit, a host diligently checked our reservation at the entrance.

The interior strikes a perfect balance between playful and sophisticated.
Clean, purposeful design is complemented by thoughtful details like fresh flowers on each table - an uncommon sight in most coffee shops.

The menu is truly unique - presented in a school notebook format that evokes nostalgic childhood memories.
The opening page features a quality manifesto, highlighting their commitment to using only premium ingredients.
